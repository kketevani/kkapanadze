excerpt: In 2012, the Parliament of Georgia was relocated from the capital city Tbilisi to a secondary town Kutaisi. In this paper, we study how Parliament's relocation affected local economic development and voting behavior within Kutaisi. We use a difference-in-difference design and show that Parliament relocation led to economic revival in zones close to Parliament - increased population density, increased establishments of restaurants & shops and increased rental prices. Moreover, using voting data we show that people became more politically active in zones near the Parliament. Interestingly, in 2018, the Parliament moved back to Tbilisi, and we expect that the positive effects within Kutaisi due to Parliament relocation should be reduced.
