title: Russia’s Wartime Economy. Measuring Regional Inequalities from Outer Space
---

This study examines the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as a natural
experiment to assess the impact of disrupted international market access on regional
economic inequalities in Russia. Using nighttime lights data as a proxy for economic
activity, we compare cities near the EU and Ukrainian borders, where market access
was restricted, to cities in southern Russia, which benefited from reoriented trade
networks. Our findings reveal that western border cities experienced economic decline
due to reduced trade and industrial disruptions, while southern cities showed relative
resilience, likely driven by increased trade with non-Western markets. These results
highlight the uneven economic impact of the war, with some regions adapting while
others stagnate. This study contributes to the understanding of how geopolitical shocks
reshape economic geography, offering insights into the long-term consequences of trade
disruptions, sanctions, and shifting supply chains on regional development.
