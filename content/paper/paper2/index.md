excerpt:  Why and where do economic activities agglomerate in cities? This paper explores a unique quasi-natural experiment of removing borders between European cities that were once united in the past and then divided due to major conflicts. I show that local economic activities, measured by remotely sensed nightlight became more concentrated close to the early 20t h century prewar centers in the formerly united cities after lifting borders. Using European business register datasets, I show that only market access is insufficient to explain the agglomeration sources within cities thoroughly. I find that the political & economic union did not immediately reshape the divided citiesâ€™ internal structure. The broader market access from the enlargement of the EU in 2004 could not explain why economic activities concentrate within border cities. Though, I uncovered that the proximity to the former centers became more prominent after abolishing internal border controls and establishing an area of free movement of people in 2008. Besides, I account for two main channels. First, I show that firms in the consumption sector, which are more exposed to the free movement of people, were more likely to start operating closer to prewar centers than firms in the production sectors, less affected by local market potentials; the consumption sectors are wholesale & retail trade and accommodation & food services. Second, I show that historical memory plays a salient role in the agglomeration of economic activities and concentrate near former historical centers in cities that do not consider language and cultural differences with twin city pairs as a major problem.
