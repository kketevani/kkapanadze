excerpt: Do spatial concentrations of economic activities have deep historical roots in Europe? This paper explores a unique quasi-natural experiment of removing borders within cities that used to be one city in the past and then divided due to border shifts following major historical conflicts. Overall, I find that local  economic activities, measured by remotely sensed nightlight, became more concentrated close to the pre- division centers in the formerly united cities after lifting borders. Which type of borders is more important  to spur agglomeration, is it the free movement of goods or people? When looking into potential mechanisms behind the impact, using national business register databases, I find that the proximity to the former historical centers become more prominent in particular after the policy of the free movement of people as a part of Schengen agreement in 2008, whereas getting the broader market access following the EU 2004 enlargement is less important. Besides, I account for two main channels. First, I show that firms in the consumption sector are more exposed to the free movement of people and are more likely to start operating closer to former centers than firms in the production sectors, which is less affected by local market potentials. Second, I show that cities where cultural and language differences are not barriers to cross-border cooperation are more influenced by free movement of people than cities where barriers still exist. Hence, spatial agglomerations near pre-division centers are more apparent in almost "borderless" cities.
