excerpt: Why and where do economic activities agglomerate in cities? In this paper, I explore a unique quasi-natural experiment, such as removing border barriers in divided cities in Europe - cities that were once united in the past. I show that local economic activities become more concentrated close to the former historical centers after lifting borders. I found that nightlight growth rates in areas close to historical city centers outgrew the rest zones after 2008. Using European business register databases, I uncovered that the proximity to historical centers matters because more economic entities in the wholesale & retail sector had been established near historical centers after the Schengen agreement. My results suggest that historical memory plays a salient role in explaining the changes in internal city structure if we bring together what belongs together.
