excerpt: Why and where do economic activities agglomerate in cities? In this paper, I explore
a unique quasi-natural experiment, such as removing borders between divided cities in
Europe - cities that were once united in the past. I show that, after lifting borders in 2008, local economic activities became more concentrated close to the  early 20th century prewar centers in the formerly united cities. I found that nightlight growth rates in areas close to former historical centers outgrew the rest zones. Using European business register databases,
I uncovered that the proximity to the former centers matters because more economic entities in the
wholesale & retail sector had been established in these zones after the Schengen agreement. My results suggest that historical memory plays a salient role in explaining the changes in internal city structure if we bring together what belongs together.
