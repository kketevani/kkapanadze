excerpt: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, including the temporary suspension of the principle of free movement within the Schengen Area. I evaluate the potential economic cost of controlling European borders during the pandemic. I use unconventional data sources such as NASAâ€™s Black Marble Nighttime Lights (NTL) products to provide insights into the socioeconomic impact of border restrictions on European municipalities. I find the heterogeneity in effects on the economic consequences of border controls. My results suggest that the impacts of travel limitations vary across cities; cross-border cities tend to lose relative to interior cities, particularly small border cities. Moreover, I find a larger decline in NTL radiance in border municipalities of new member states compared to old member states. Using the municipality-type subgroups, this paper concludes that industrial, consumer and service oriented border cities are adversely affected from temporary segregation. Besides, there was a significant reduction in NTL in municipalities where people oftentimes commute to foreign cross-border areas for shopping, leisure, and business purposes; where large number of residents are employed; and where people have high awareness about EU funded cross-border activities and perceive living near the international border as economic potential rather than barrier.
