excerpt: It has been almost a quarter-century since the Schengen Area was founded in 1995. Since then, there have been no such tight restrictions on internal borders as during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Since a pandemic is a present- time shock, evaluating the socioeconomic impact is limited. To overcome this challenge, I use an unconventional data source, NASAâ€™s Black Marble Nighttime Lights (NTL) products, to measure the potential economic cost of controlling European borders. I have constructed a novel geo-coded NTL dataset spanning the pre-and post-periods of introducing border controls in European municipalities. This study demonstrates that remotely sensed monthly NTL intensity decreased in border regions after the imposing of border controls compared to the interior areas. I found that border restrictions had heterogeneous effects. The decline in NTL radiance in border municipalities compared to interiors is approximately 4% larger in New Member States (East) than in Old Member States (West). Moreover, using a cross-border (CB) cooperation survey which was conducted in 2020, I introduce municipality-type subgroups which explain the main channels of severe decline in NTL in border regions after imposing border controls. I expect that if residents oftentimes travel abroad, commute to neighboring border regions, reside in large cities, and are skilled workers, such border regions lose the most from COVID-19-induced border restrictions. Moreover, for respondents who commute to foreign cross-border regions because of leisure or work, or shopping, the decline in NTL should be major in the cross-border regions where they would commute under "normal" situations.
