description: "I am Ketevani Kapanadze, a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI, Prague. I have recently joined the Faculty of Law, Economics Deparment of Charles University as an Assistnat Professor (non-tenure) - Postdoctoral researcher on the project of [EqualStrength](https://equalstrength.eu), led by Josef Montag.  
<br> I am CERGE-EI Foundation Teaching Fellow (NY, USA). 
<br> I am a team member of the National Institute for Research on the Socioeconomic Impacts of Disease and Systemic Risks (SYRI).
<br> My current research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban & regional economics and European integration.  I enjoy working with large datasets and employ modern techniques to crawl data and create databases from open sources. I also work with remotely sensed images and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images."
