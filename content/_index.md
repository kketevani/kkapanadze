description: "I am Ketevani Kapanadze, a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI, Prague. I am participating in the 2022–2023 academic job market. My current research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban & regional economics, labor economics and European integration. In 2019-2020, I was a visiting researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 2021, I became young economist of the year - the prize by _the Czech Economic Society_. [The award winning paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clfTVJZ4ETX-mJCT7LZaJz2TztiIhL65/view?usp=sharing) is currently under R&R in _the Journal of Economic Geography_. 

<br><br> I enjoy working with large datasets and employ modern techniques to crawl data and create databases from open sources. I also work with remotely sensed images and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images.

<br><br> 📰 You can find my [Job Market Paper here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q7EJAZSThgoVWKASzJWu2is69OKvULgA/view?usp=sharing). <br> Do spatial concentrations of economic activities have deep historical roots in Europe? This paper explores a unique quasi-natural experiment of removing borders within cities that used to be one city in the past and then divided due to border shifts following major historical conflicts. I show that local economic activities concentrated close to the early 20th century pre-division centers after the Schengen zone was created. Besides, I find that the consumption sector and language & cultural similiarities play a salient role in defining agglomeration forces - such channels can _bring together what belongs together._
