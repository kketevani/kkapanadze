description: "My name is Ketevani Kapanadze. 
<br> I am an Assistant professor (non-tenure) at Charles University, Faculty of Law, and I am working as a postdoc on [EqualStrength](https://equalstrength.eu). 
<br> I have obtained Ph.D. in Economics and Econometrics from CERGE-EI.   
<br> I am a member oof CERGE-EI Foundation Teaching Fellow (NY, USA) and the National Institute for Research on the Socioeconomic Impacts of Disease and Systemic Risks (SYRI).

<br><br> My research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, remote sensing, and European spatial and racial segregation.  
<br><br> I enjoy working with large datasets and employ modern techniques to crawl data and create databases from open sources. I also work with remotely sensed images and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images."
