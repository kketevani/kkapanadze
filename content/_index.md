description: "I am Ketevani Kapanadze, a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI, Prague. I am participating in the 2022–2023 academic job market. My current research interests lie at the intersection of economic geography, urban & regional economics, labor economics and European integration. In 2019-2020, I was a visiting researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 2021, I became young economist of the year - the prize by _the Czech Economic Society_. [The award winning paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clfTVJZ4ETX-mJCT7LZaJz2TztiIhL65/view?usp=sharing) is currently under R&R in _the Journal of Economic Geography_. 

<br><br> I enjoy working with large datasets and employ modern techniques to crawl data and create databases from open sources. I also work with remotely sensed images and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images.

<br><br> 📰 You can find my [Job Market Paper here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q7EJAZSThgoVWKASzJWu2is69OKvULgA/view?usp=sharing).
