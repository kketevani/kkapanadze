description: Hi, I am Ketevani Kapanadze, a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI, Prague. I am participating in the 2022–2023 academic job market. My research interests lie in economic geography, urban & regional economics, and European integration. Currently, I became interested in covid economics. 

I enjoy working with large datasets and employ modern techniques to data scrape and create databases from open sources. I also work with remotely sensed images and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images.
