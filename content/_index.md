description: " 
My name is Ketevani Kapanadze. I am a research fellow at the European Research University (ERUNI) in Prague. I obtained Ph.D. in Economics and Econometrics from CERGE-EI. I am a member of CERGE-EI Foundation Teaching Fellow (NY, USA).  

<br><br> My research interests lie at the intersection of urban and regional economics, economic geography, and political economy, with a regional focus on Europe and its border areas. I am interested in the drivers of uneven regional development and in how local political decisions influence economic performance. To address the limitations of geospatial economic data, I employ modern techniques to collect unconventional data from open sources and utilize remotely sensed images, including daytime and nighttime satellite imagery, in my economic analysis.
