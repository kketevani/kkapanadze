description: Hi, I am Ketevani Kapanadze, a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI, Prague. My research interests lie in economic geography, urban & regional economics, and European integration. Recently, I became interested in covid economics. I also enjoy remote sensing and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images.
