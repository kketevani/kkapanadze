description: " 
My name is Ketevani Kapanadze. I am a research fellow at the European Research University (ERUNI) in Prague. I obtained Ph.D. in Economics and Econometrics from CERGE-EI. I am a member of CERGE-EI Foundation Teaching Fellow (NY, USA) and the National Institute for Research on the Socioeconomic Impacts of Disease and Systemic Risks (SYRI).  

<br><br> My research interests lie at the intersection of regional economics, remote sensing, and spatial segregations within Europe, with a special focus on border areas. I'm interested in understanding why some areas experience better economic growth than others, particularly in how localised shocks impact local economies. To address limitations of traditional geospatial economic data, I use modern techniques to gather data from open sources and incorporate remotely sensed images, including daytime and nighttime satellite imagery, in my economic analysis."
