description: "I am Ketevani Kapanadze, a Ph.D. candidate at CERGE-EI, Prague. I am participating in the 2022–2023 academic job market. My research interests lie in economic geography, urban & regional economics, and European integration. In 2020, I was a visiting researcher at the Real Estate department, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 2021, I became the young economist of the year - the prize by _the Czech Economic Society_. [The award winning paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clfTVJZ4ETX-mJCT7LZaJz2TztiIhL65/view?usp=sharing) is currently under R&R in _the Journal of Economic Geography_. 

<br><br> 👩‍💻 I enjoy working with large datasets and employ modern techniques to crawl data and create databases from open sources. I also work with remotely sensed images and use unconventional data sources for economic analysis - daytime & nighttime satellite images.

<br><br> 📰 You can find my [Job Market Paper here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YbYNiyKaRXP1bTp3boCB83lLV-rjjwgj/view?usp=sharing). This paper explores a unique quasi-natural experiment of removing borders between European cities that were once united in the past and then divided due to major conflicts. I show that local economic activities concentrated close to the early 20th century prewar centers after borderless Europe - Schengen zone was created. Besides, I find that consumption sector and historical memory plays a salient role in defining agglomeration sources - such channels can _bring together what belongs together._"
